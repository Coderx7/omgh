توبره - Some Bag-of-words model for visual categorization


What does toobreh mean?
-----------------------

توبره is the Farsi word reffering to a bag.

What are my intentions?
-----------------------

I want to implement some basic bag-of-words models for visual image categorization.

Specifically I'll be implementing models described in [1], both the _universal_ vocabulary and the _adabtive_ vocabulary.

I should find some pretty simple datasets to try this on.
